# 📧 Spam Detection using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Spam Detection System** using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.
The model classifies SMS messages as:

* ✅ **Ham (Not Spam)**
* 🚫 **Spam**

The system uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text data into numerical features and then trains a classification model.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Convert text messages into numerical format
* Train a machine learning model for classification
* Evaluate model performance
* Visualize results using graphs and word clouds

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* File used: `datasetspam.csv`
* Important columns:

  * `text` → Message content
  * `label_num` → Target label (0 = Ham, 1 = Spam)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* WordCloud

---

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

* Dataset is loaded using Pandas
* Only relevant columns are selected

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Renaming columns:

  * `text` → `message`
  * `label_num` → `label`

### 3. Feature Extraction

* Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
* Converts text into numerical form

### 4. Model Training

* Algorithm: **Logistic Regression**
* Data split into:

  * 80% Training
  * 20% Testing

### 5. Prediction

* Model predicts whether a message is spam or not

### 6. Evaluation

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix

### 7. Visualization

* Confusion Matrix Plot 📊
* WordCloud for:

  * Spam messages ☁️
  * Ham messages ☁️
